Requiements in horrible layouts :^)

install mongodb community version
install Python 3

run "python -m pip install -r requirements.txt" with right version of python
start up mongodb
run mongo_app.py

server should start and you can connect to it at localhost:1911/
right now only supports /teacher GET POST
will add more server API infor later
